# airplaneWingAnalysis
Program to analyse and represent several aerodynamic properties of an airplane.

## Disclaimer
Lifting line solution section is developed by Enrique Ortega (e.ortega@upc.edu), professor at UPC.

## Results
The code generates a terminal output regarding the most relevant numerical properties.

_The stability margin is 0.3467._<br>
_CMcg at design lift is -0.5296._<br>
_Stall speed is 95.73._<br>
_Stall position is at -0.45 from root._<br>
_Maximum CL is 1.59._<br>
_SCL margin at SF=1 is 26.73._<br>
_Safety factors are: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2._<br>
  _AOAs are 12.46ยบ, 13.82ยบ, 15.18ยบ._<br>
  _CDs are 0.04812, 0.05918, 0.07152._

Also, it gives up to 20+ plots on the wing's behaviour.
